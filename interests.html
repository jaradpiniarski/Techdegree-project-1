          <h2>Woodworking</h2>
          <p>I have been working with tools for as long as I can remember. I have always enjoyed building things and taking things apart. In my early twenties, I developed a love for building furniture and useful items out of wood. In the past ten years I have improved my woodworking ability and created some beautiful custom pieces for friends and family.</p>

          <h2>Motorcycles</h2>
          <p>I grew up around motorcyles and have always been fascinated by them. I purchased my first motorcycle, a 1975 Honda CB550, in 2008 and quickly began learning how customize and repair vintage japanese bikes. After a few years, I was finally able to purchase a 1977 Harley Davidson XLH Sportster, that I am currently building in my garage.</p>

            <h2>Parenting</h2>
            <p>While not as relaxing as woodworking or working on motorcycles, my biggest interest is my children. I have three sons and they are the motivation for nearly everything that I do. I have done a lot of great things in my life, but none of it compares to being a father.</p>
